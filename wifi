# This script is used to automatically connect to a wifi network of my
# choice (using networking), in this case, PASCAL.  I wrote this
# script when I used on all the stupid Lenovo S10-3Cs at Virtual Labs
# and wicd refused to work, for albeit reasons.  I could have
# soft-wired the ESSID, but decided against it, as I used to use
# PASCAL 90% of the time, and I didn't have the comfort of using GnomeX.
